# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

I was asked by my instructors to update code for acessibility purposes and better SEO visibility. I did this by substituting standard <div> attributes for more specific semantic attributes in each section of the web docs html. 


# Title
I added the title "Horiseon Web Servies" in order to give the website more SEO visibility when searched for in a web browser.

## Semantic Language

I added a <header> element where the navigation and logo are placed.
I added a <main> element to include the sections of the web page where the most important infromation is placed.
For each section of information within the <main> element I added a <section> element.
For the information in the side bar I placed each section within the <aside> element.
Each section of information within the side bar is placed within its on <section> element.
The <div> that holds content for the footer is replaced by a <footer> element.


## Images 
Each image recieved its own "alt" description. 

## Formatting 
I formtted the html document for better readability.
